# Cloud Uploader CLI Tool

## Overview
The Cloud Uploader CLI Tool is a bash-based command-line utility that allows users to easily upload files to a specified cloud storage solution, providing a seamless experience similar to popular storage services.

## Prerequisites
- Bash shell
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials (if using AWS S3)
- Internet connectivity (for uploading files to cloud storage)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-uploader.git
   ```

2. Change into the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd cloud-uploader
   ```

3. Run the installation script to copy the script to a directory in your $PATH:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

   **Note:** The installation script will copy the `clouduploader.sh` script to `/usr/local/bin` and make it executable. You may need to enter your password for sudo access.

   Alternatively, you can manually copy the script to a directory in your $PATH and make it executable.

## Usage
```bash
clouduploader.sh <file_path> <s3_directory> <storage_class>
```

- `<file_path>`: Path to the file you want to upload.
- `<s3_directory>`: Destination directory in the cloud storage.
- `<storage_class>`: Storage class for the uploaded object (optional).

Example:
```bash
clouduploader.sh /path/to/file.txt s3://my-bucket/my-folder/ STANDARD_IA
```

## Features
- Single-file upload to cloud storage.
- Error handling for file not found and upload failure.

## Advanced Features (Optional)
- Multiple file uploads at once.
- Progress bar or percentage upload completion.
- Generate and display shareable links post-upload.
- File synchronization (overwrite, skip, or rename).
- Encryption for added security.

## Troubleshooting
- **File not found:** Ensure the file path provided is correct.
- **Upload failure:** Check internet connectivity and AWS credentials.
